- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

I took inspiration from the movie Howl's Moving Castle and created a Flying Castle class. The class represents a moving castle, and most actions will be commanded by the user. In the movie, the castle has legs and wings so I think my flying castle should be able to walk, grab things, drop things, examine and use things, take off, and fly. The 'undo' command lets the user delete the most recent action from the history log. The user can also grow and shrink the house using a spell (which is grow() and shrink()), but the default value is 10 for each time using this spell. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I did not implement any new methods, but I added a history log, a list of items, a castle's size and a boolean indicating whether the castle is flying or not.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was pretty confused by the 'Number' return type of grow() and shrink(), but it worked out in the end. I would advise them to be creative and just play around with open assignments like this, as it really helps me understand Java better.
